# Overview

MyFriendBinny is a program for tracking storage bin inventory and the items stored in those bins.  This is the third version and is specifically an Android mobile app.  So far, the app only keeps track of Bin names and their descriptions.  Future enhancements will allow editing the Bins and adding Items to the bins.

The main screen shows the Bin List which is a scrollable list.  An "+" button allows you to add new bins.

The purpose for creating this app is to learn how to create Android Mobile Apps using Android Studio and Kotlin.
